- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattrogan!

- 🎓 Currently, I am broadening my skill set by looking into Domain Driven Design (DDD - domain events, rich domain models, aggregates & aggregate roots).  
- 🌐 As a developer, my skill set includes using C# (EF Core, ASP.NET MVC, RESTful APIs, Unit Tests with TDD, Functional Tests), SQL Server, Docker, and Azure DevOps. These are used in an Agile development environment.
